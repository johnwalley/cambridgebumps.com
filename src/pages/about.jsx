                How do Bumps work?
              </h3>
              <p className="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                The River Cam is an awful place to hold a rowing event. Narrow
                and winding, it&apos;s simply not possible to stage a
                conventional side-by-side regatta; so Bumps racing evolved in
                the 1820s to let large numbers of boats to compete against one
                another.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                Men and women race separately. Boats are split into multiple
                divisions. Each division has 17-18 boats and crews start 90 feet
                apart.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                The aim of the race is to catch and &lsquo;bump&rsquo; the crew
                in front of you. A bump is awarded if the crew in front
                concedes. And yes, this can require you to actually hit the boat
                in front! Crews that bump one another must pull over to the side
                to allow the crews behind to continue.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                Racing takes place over four days with the finishing order at
                the end of a day determining the starting order for the
                following day. This means that a crew which bumps the crew in
                front will gain their starting position for the next day.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                A crew which ends up at the top of their division gets to race
                again at the bottom of the next division on the same day. This
                crew is known as the sandwich boat due to the fact that they are
                sandwiched between two divisions. The honour is double-edged
                because while you get the opportunity to go up a division you
                also must race twice in one day!
              </p>
              <p className="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                The crew which ends the week at the top of the first division is
                awarded the headship, or head of the river. Due to the nature of
                Bumps this might not necessarily be the fastest crew, but it is
                always a mighty achievement and well deserved.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                Crews which achieve a bump are given willow branches to
                &lsquo;wear&rsquo; as they row back to their boathouses.
