  about: "The river in Oxford presents a unique challenge for hosting traditional rowing competitions. Its meandering course and limited width render standard side-by-side racing impractical. To accommodate the constraints of the river and to enable numerous crews to participate, the Oxford Bumps races emerged. This format, different from conventional regattas, was developed to allow a large number of boats to compete in a dynamic and exciting manner, turning the river's limitations into a unique aspect of the race.",
